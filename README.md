# Student-Gradebook
Implementing a program to manage student grades for a module. You will be creating a main class, called XX007, which will prompt the user to enter the number of students taking the module and create an array to store the relevant information for each student.

For each student, you will prompt the user to enter their personal information and grades for homework assignments, an Interim Test, and an exam. You will then calculate the coursework mark and final mark for each student using weighted averages.

Finally, you will print out the names of the students and their marks in a tabular form for easy viewing. This program will help you to efficiently manage and analyze student grades, making it a valuable tool for any academic or professional setting.
